TODO List:

IMPORTANT:
Dependency list in readme (including c# libraries and nuget packages, with copyright notice)

Bot core:
IMPORTANT: Remove as many try/catch statements as possible and replace with better functions
IMPORTANT: Clean and format README
IMPORTANT: Reduce string and constructor usage and replace with enums
IMPORTANT: Add CMD-R Version system (it should work with patch numbers, allowing minimal patch version in modules, howerver, the patch class should also have a version identity string)

Offline status through seperate program
Run cmd-r in background and control it from a different program
